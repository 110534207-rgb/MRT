# Proposal: Implement MRT Map Features

This change implements the full set of features for the interactive MRT map pages, as specified in the System Analysis document (`doc/SA.md`).

The goal is to ensure that every existing and future MRT line's HTML file is a complete, self-contained web application that provides both visitor and administrator functionalities.
